            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>With a robust background spanning over 8 years in the dynamic tech industry, I bring a wealth of diverse
                experiences that have shaped my versatile skill set. My journey began with roles in HelpDesk Support and
                Field Tech Support, where I honed my expertise in providing comprehensive network and devices support.
                Evolving further, I transitioned into the realm of Full-Stack Java development, showcasing my commitment
                to continuous growth and adaptability.

                <br>As a results-oriented professional, I thrive in agile environments, leveraging my proven ability to
                navigate complex challenges and meet critical project deadlines. My proficiency extends beyond
                conventional development tasks; I excel in performing thorough systems auditing and analysis, ensuring
                optimal performance and security measures. Configuring software setups is not just a task but a
                testament to my commitment to delivering high-quality solutions.<br>

                <br>One of my standout strengths lies in effective communication and interpersonal skills. Whether
                collaborating with cross-functional teams, engaging with clients, or presenting solutions, I bring
                clarity and enthusiasm to every interaction. This blend of technical expertise and interpersonal finesse
                positions me as a valuable asset in any collaborative and dynamic tech environment.<br>

                <br>Let's connect and explore how my multifaceted experiences can contribute to the success of our
                shared endeavors.<br>

                    <h3>The Virtual Pet</h3>
                    <p>In this Virtual Pet project, I created a pet from a VirtualPet class and set up a game loop for
                        user interaction in VirtualPetApp class. For this project, I created a VirtualPetShelter class
                        that allows the user to house and care for a collection of pets. I organized my code to have my
                        VirtualPetApp call methods from VirtualPetShelter which interacted with my VirtualPet objects.
                        I used TDD on this project, and incorporated testing.</p>

                    <p>I created a website that uses button clicks to create donuts. The donuts can be used as currency
                        to buy Auto Clickers, which will be used to make even more donuts!I implemented a Header section
                        which contains a navigation menu that when clicked will expand sections about:

                        Displays the amount of Donuts made.
                        A section that interacts with the AutoClicker
                        Displays the amount of Auto Clickers purchased.
                        Provides a button to purchase Auto Clickers.
                        Button is disabled when you do not have enough Donuts to buy an Auto Clicker.</p>

                    <p>This was my personal portfolio asked to be implemented when I enrolled to WeCanCodeIT Bootcamp.
                        I was told to create something even though we were yet to be introduced to Java. I was able to
                        use previous exposure to Java and created this. It was fun rekindling my lost but now found love
                        for coding. I got excited as always dealing with programming languages (I also built the website
                        of course!)
